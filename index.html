<h4 class="subtitle" style="margin-top: 0cm">2.1. Adaptive Reverberation Effects (2008)</h4>

<figure>
	<a href="Images/Reverberation.jpg"><img src="Images/reverberation.jpg" alt="reverberation"></a>
	<figcaption><b>Fig.2.</b> A user rating a sound modified by a series of reverberation settings as to how well it fits her/his audio concept of "boomy" she/he had in mind.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>People often think about sound in terms of subjective concepts which do not necessarily have known mappings onto the controls of existing audio tools. For example, a bass player may wish to use a reverberation effect to make her/his bass sound more "boomy", but unfortunately there is no "boomy" knob to be found. We developed a system that can quickly learn an audio concept from a user (e.g., a "boomy" effect) and generate a simple controller than can manipulate sounds in terms of that audio concept (e.g., make a sound more "boomy"), bypassing the bottleneck of technical knowledge of complex interfaces and individual differences in subjective terms.</p>

<p>For this study, we focused on reverberation effects. We developed a digital reverberator, mapping the parameters of the digital filters to measures of the reverberation effect, so that the reverberator can be controlled through meaningful descriptors such as "reverberation time" or "spectral centroid." In the learning process, a sound is first modified by a series of reverberation settings using the reverberator. The user then listens and rates each modified sound as to how well it fits the audio concept she/he has in mind. The ratings are finally mapped onto the controls of the reverberator and a simple controller is built with which the user is able to manipulate the degree of her/his audio concept on a sound. Several experiments conducted on human subjects showed that the system learns quickly (under 3 minutes), predicts user responses well (mean correlation of 0.75), and meets users' expectations (average human rating of 7.4 out of 10).</p>

<h4 class="subtitle" style="margin-top: 0cm">2.2. DUET using the CQT (2011)</h4>

<figure>
	<a href="Images/Duet.png"><img src="Images/duet.png" alt="duet"></a>
	<figcaption><b>Fig.3.</b> Blind separation of a stereo recording of Homer, Bart, and Lisa using DUET.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique (DUET) is a blind source separation method that can separate an arbitrary number of unknown sources using a single stereo mixture. DUET builds a two-dimensional histogram from the amplitude ratio and phase difference between channels, where each peak indicates a source, with peak location corresponding to the mixing parameters associated with that source. Provided that the time-frequency bins of the sources do not overlap too much - an assumption generally validated by speech mixtures, DUET partitions the time-frequency representation of the mixture by assigning each bin to the source with the closest mixing parameters. However, when time-frequency bins of the sources start to overlap more - as generally seen in music mixtures when using the common short-time Fourier transform (STFT), peaks start to fuse in the 2d histogram and DUET cannot perform separation effectively.</p>

<p>We proposed to improve peak/source separation in DUET by building the 2d histogram from an alternative time-frequency representation based on the constant-Q transform (CQT). Unlike the Fourier transform, the CQT has a logarithmic frequency resolution, mirroring the human auditory system and matching the geometrically spaced frequencies of the Western music scale, therefore better adapted to music mixtures. We also proposed other contributions to enhance DUET, such as adaptive boundaries for the 2d histogram to improve peak resolving when sources are spatially too close to each other, and Wiener filtering to improve source reconstruction. Experiments on mixtures of piano notes and harmonic sources showed that peak/source separation is overall improved, especially at low octaves (under 200 Hz) and for small mixing angles (under pi/6 rad).</p>


</div>

<div class="twocolumn">

<p>Unlike the classic DUET based on the Fourier transform, DUET combined with the CQT can resolve adjacent pitches in low octaves as well as in high octaves thanks to the log frequency resolution of the CQT:</p>

<figure>

	<figcaption><b>Fig.4.</b> Overview of the fingerprinting stage. The audio signal is first transformed into a log-frequency spectrogram by using the CQT. The CQT-based spectrogram is then transformed into a binary image by using an adaptive thresholding method.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Suppose that you are at a music festival checking on an artist, and you would like to quickly know about the song that is being played (e.g., title, lyrics, album, etc.). If you have a smartphone, you could record a sample of the live performance and compare it against a database of existing recordings from the artist. Services such as Shazam or SoundHound will not work here, as this is not the typical framework for audio fingerprinting or query-by-humming systems, as a live performance is neither identical to its studio version (e.g., variations in instrumentation, key, tempo, etc.) nor it is a hummed or sung melody. We propose an audio fingerprinting system that can deal with live version identification by using image processing techniques. Compact fingerprints are derived using a log-frequency spectrogram and an adaptive thresholding method, and template matching is performed using the Hamming similarity and the Hough Transform.</p>

	<figcaption><b>Fig.5.</b> Results for an audio example encoded with AC-3. The system identified traces of compression corresponding to AC-3, but not to other lossy coding formats such as MP3, AAC, Vorbis, or WMA.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We propose a system which can estimate from an audio recording that has previously undergone lossy compression the parameters used for the encoding, and therefore identify the corresponding lossy coding format. The system analyzes the audio signal and searches for the compression parameters and framing conditions which match those used for the encoding. In particular, we propose a new metric for measuring traces of compression which is robust to variations in the audio content and a new method for combining the estimates from multiple audio blocks which can refine the results. We evaluated this system with audio excerpts from songs and movies, compressed into various coding
formats, using different bit rates, and captured digitally as well as through analog transfer. Results showed that our system can
identify the correct format in almost all cases, even at high bitrates and with distorted audio, with an overall accuracy of 0.96.</p>

	<figcaption><b>Fig.6.</b> Kernels derived from the (a) Hanning, (b) Blackman, (c) triangular, (d) Parzen, (e) Gaussian (with <i>&alpha;</i> = 2.5), and (f) Kaiser (with <i>&beta;</i> = 0.5) windows.

kernels are shown. The values are displayed in log of amplitude.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The sliding discrete Fourier transform (SDFT) is an efficient method for computing the N-point DFT of a given signal starting at a given sample from the N-point DFT of the same signal starting at the previous sample. However, the SDFT does not allow the use of a window function, generally incorporated in the computation of the DFT to reduce spectral leakage, as it would break its sliding property. We show how windowing can be included in the SDFT by using a kernel derived from the window function, while keeping the process computationally efficient. In addition, this approach allows for turning other transforms, such as the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), into efficient sliding versions of themselves.</p>

	<figcaption><b>Fig.7.</b> Overview of REPET.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Repetition is a fundamental element in generating and perceiving structure. In audio, mixtures are often composed of structures where a repeating background signal is superimposed with a varying foreground signal. On this basis, we present the REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET), a simple approach for separating the repeating background from the non-repeating foreground in an audio mixture. The basic idea is to find the repeating elements in the mixture, derive the underlying repeating models, and extract the repeating background by comparing the models to the mixture. Unlike other separation approaches, REPET does not depend on special parameterizations, does not rely on complex frameworks, and does not require external information. Because it is only based on repetition, it has the advantage of being simple, fast, blind, and therefore completely and easily automatable.</p>

<h4 class="subtitle">3.1 Original REPET (2011)</h4>

</figure>

<p>The original REPET aims at identifying and extracting the repeating patterns in an audio mixture, by estimating a period of the underlying repeating structure and modeling a segment of the periodically repeating background.</p>

<p>Experiments on a data set of song clips showed that REPET can be effectively applied for music/voice separation. Experiments also showed that REPET can be combined with other methods to improve background/foreground separation; for example, it can be used as a preprocessor to pitch detection algorithms to improve melody extraction, or as a postprocessor to a singing voice separation algorithm to improve music/voice separation.</p>

<p>REPET can be easily extended to handle varying repeating structures, by simply applying the method along time, on individual segments or via a sliding window. Experiments on a data set of full-track real-world songs showed that this method can be effectively applied for music/voice separation.</p>

<p>The original REPET works well when the repeating background is relatively stable (e.g., a verse or the chorus in a song); however, the repeating background can also vary over time (e.g., a verse followed by the chorus in the song). The adaptive REPET is an extension of the original REPET that can handle varying repeating structures, by estimating the time-varying repeating periods and extracting the repeating background locally, without the need for segmentation or windowing.</p>

</figure>

<p>The REPET methods work well when the repeating background has periodically repeating patterns (e.g., jackhammer noise); however, the repeating patterns can also happen intermittently or without a global or local periodicity (e.g., frogs by a pond). REPET-SIM is a generalization of REPET that can also handle non-periodically repeating structures, by using a similarity matrix to identify the repeating elements.</p>

</div>

<div class="twocolumn">

<p>Experiments on a data set of full-track real-world songs showed that REPET-SIM can be effectively applied for music/voice separation.</p>

<p>REPET-SIM can be easily implemented online to handle real-time computing, particularly for real-time speech enhancement. The online REPET-SIM simply processes the time frames of the mixture one after the other given a buffer that temporally stores past frames. Experiments on a data set of two-channel mixtures of one speech source and real-world background noise showed that the online REPET-SIM can be effectively applied for real-time speech enhancement.</p>

<h4 class="subtitle" style="margin-top: 0cm">3.4 uREPET (2015)</h4>

<p>Repetition is a fundamental element in generating and perceiving structure in audio. Especially in music, structures tend to be composed of patterns that repeat through time (e.g., rhythmic elements in a musical accompaniment), and also frequency (e.g., different notes of the same instrument). The auditory system has the remarkable ability to parse such patterns by identifying repetitions within the audio mixture. On this basis, we propose a simple user interface system for recovering patterns repeating in time and frequency in mixtures of sounds. A user selects a region in the log-frequency spectrogram of an audio recording from which she/he wishes to recover a repeating pattern covered by an undesired element (e.g., a note covered by a cough). The selected region is then cross-correlated with the spectrogram to identify similar regions where the underlying pattern repeats. The identified regions are finally averaged over their repetitions and the repeating pattern is recovered.</p>

<h4 class="subtitle">3.5 PROJET-MAG (2017)</h4>

<p>We propose a simple user-assisted method for the recovery of repeating patterns in time and frequency which can occur in mixtures of sounds. Here, the user selects a region in a logfrequency spectrogram from which they seek to recover the underlying pattern which is obscured by another interfering source, such as a chord masked by a cough. A cross-correlation is then performed between the selected region and the spectrogram, revealing similar regions. The most similar region is then selected and a variant on the PROJET algorithm, termed PROJET-MAG, is then used to extract the common time-frequency components from the two regions, as well as extracting the components which are not common to both. The results obtained are compared to another user-assisted method based on REPET, and the PROJET-MAG method is demonstrated to give improved results over this baseline.</p>
